I realized that many people confused the roles of a manager with the roles of a technology leader. I started to put the following original quote in my presentations: Managers think about today. Leaders think about tomorrow. - Dan McCreary This quote has been widely used many other setting and I always appreciate attribution! Management focuses on the day-to-day tasks of managing people, budgets and compliance. Leadership is about creating a clear vision of the future and letting everyone know how to get there. Very few people excel at both management and leadership. Great technologists seldom enjoy day-to-day management tasks. My Favorite Quotes From Others \u00b6 Knowledge Representation \u00b6 Representation is the hardest part of AI. - Jeff Hawkins This quote guides most of my research in AI and knowledge representation. You can think of this as a metaphor for the famous 1976 book by Niklaus Wirth: Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs which covers some of the fundamental topics of computer programming. In summary, many hard problems in Computer Science and AI become easy when you pick the right data structure or the right representation of knowledge. Forcing all data to fit into tabular structures is often a recipe for failure. Predicting the Future \u00b6 Never mistake a clear view for a short distance. - Paul Saffo This is sometimes stated as: Never mistake a clear view of the future for a short distance. Innovation at the Seams of Technology \u00b6 Innovation occurs at the seams of technology. - David Canter The full version is: As a technology generalist, I have found that tremendous innovation occurs at the seams of technology domains.
