But, with Dan there was no need. He reminds me of someone like Neil deGrasse Tyson in the sense that he knows so much about his field but excels at being able to break it down in a way that those outside his field can easily gain a basic understanding. This is a rare talent and I would be ecstatic to work with him again.

In technology you rarely get a chance to work with a person that is as personable as they are technically proficient. Dan is one of those rare people and it is an absolute pleasure to work with him. Dan has led and successfully delivered very strategic pre-sales and post-sales consulting engagements for one of my top healthcare clients (a top 5 payer and health services company). I am 100% comfortable with Dan's solution identification and development skills, his presentation skills, and his excellent client relationship management.

Dan is one of the few people I trust to interact with clients on his own without involving a sales / relationship manager. He cares deeply about his clients, company (integrated account team) and their mutual success. Several key wins have happened, or opportunities have been generated, due to Dan's natural curiosity, credibility and trust he has built in understanding client strategies, goals, pains and developing solutions to help achieve them.

Dan is an "A-list" IT consulting talent and even better person. He goes the extra mile to mitigate risk (both technical and process) and ensure success, positive results and satisfaction. In return, I go the extra mile for him when he asks because he's earned it.

If you're looking for a NoSQL evangelist well versed in all things XML, XQuery, XForms, and X*, then Dan is your man. Also an excellent and patient mentor and instructor who really goes the extra mile to make sure that people "get it." His work is always well documented and his communication skills among the best I've encountered. He is able to communicate clearly and concisely at a level appropriate to the audience he is addressing be it business, management, or technical.

## University of Richmond

I helped the University of Richmond design and build
XQuery training courses for content management systems.
We did a lot of custom search systems for specific
web content all built on eXist-db.  Although Eric Palmer
was our main contact, I did a lot of great work with [Chris Kemp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-kemp-28560b7/)

Dan and I have collaborated on projects at the University of Richmond and in the open source community for years. Dan is a NoSQL Database visionary. His Enterprise Architecture experience and thinking has helped me become a better Enterprise Architect. While Dan is a visionary he is also down to earth and a very effective trainer and technical mentor. Dan’s training approach helped my team go from novice to experienced XQuery developers quickly. I’m looking forward to a continued relationship with Dan and his staff.

## NueMeta

Ann and I built custom workflow engines for processing XML representations of music license agreements for NueMenta on eXist-db.  Our key contact there was [Nick Sincaglia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-sincaglia-9623a8/).

I collaboratied with Dan to help transform a knowledge management learning organization was a "social capital reinvesting" bonus.

## Surescripts

I wrote a library of XSLT data transformation that converted XML prescriptions to and from a standard canonical format.  I also
wrote a test harness in eXist-db.  Mike told me many years later
that the tansforms had run over 3 billion times without any
signifant problems.

Dan is one of the most intelligent and enjoyable people I have worked with in the past 5 years. His depth of knowledge in data architecture is astounding, particularly in meta data, XML and business intelligence. He always brings a fresh enthusiasm to his work, and blends his experience with a broad understanding of industry standards and trends. While primarily a data architect, he is constantly looking for ways to apply new technologies, like Web Services or metadata registries, to his solutions. And he is an excellent teacher, capable of helping others understand new concepts and apply them effectively. It would be an honor to work with him again in the future.

I had the pleasure of working with Dan at Thrivent Financial on the PACE program. The original project I was to work on was put on hold and so I had the opportunity to work with Dan on a Metadata Registry he was creating with XForms and XQuery. I had not worked with those technologies before and he spent a lot of time with me training me. He was an extremely good mentor and very patient with me as I learned more. Dan's knowledge of metadata, xml, OLAP cubes, and services is extremely impressive. He is one of the most knowledgeable architects I've ever had the opportunity to work with in my career. I would highly recommend him! I hope I have the opportunity to work with him again in the future!

## Integrity Solutions

I started Integrity Solutions because I wanted to continue to build
advanced tools for managing object-relational databases interfaces.  My cofounders included [Randy Marchessault](), [Pete Clark](), [Mark Mendel](), [Tim Dawson]() and [Steve Johnson]().

#### Pete Clark

At Integrity Solutions, Dan was a visionary, building the company from the group of 7 co-founders to over 70 people.

#### Steve Kenny

* August 16, 2008
* Pete reported directly to Dan

Dan was the guiding force behind what retrospectively was a technically totally unique and trend-setting consultancy. His infectious deep belief in the merit of Object-Orientation as the basis for providing main-stream, mission-critical business solutions better and faster than any other organization around at the time was key in helping us establish a real foot-hold in the Twin Cities. He combined solid technical roots with a real ability to communicate and persuade. Many of today's common-place technologies, development practices, and team organizational methodologies were a natural part of his future-looking, Innovative, and home-brewed skill set.

#### Jack Nutting

* CTO at Shortcut Sweden
* January 13, 2009
* Dan was senior to Jack but didn't manage Jack directly

At Integrity Solutions, I worked among the best and brightest minds I've ever worked with, and Dan was integral in building that team. His broad knowledge base and clear technical vision gave the company a clear direction forward and served as a set of selection criteria for potential recruits during a period of major growth; During my 3 years there we went from under 10 people to approximately 50. Some of us used to joke that Dan would hire anybody who came into his office, but the flip-side of the joke was that Dan seemed to truly have a knack for pre-selecting people who would do a great job for the company; the slouches never made it to his office!

#### Loren Cahlander

* Digital Transformation, Data Architecture, Big data, NoSQL, Analytics & Cloud Computing
* November 22, 2008

Dan has a greater capacity for sharing his vision and enthusiasm for technology than anyone I've ever known. It was his lecture before my object-oriented programming course in college that sealed the deal on my career in tech, and as my boss and mentor in my first job after college, he provided encouragement and direction as I first began exploring ways of solving technical problems. Any success I've had in my career can be attributed largely to the experiences I had working with him and the other outstandingly smart people at Integrity Solutions, and I'll always be grateful for that opportunity.

#### Mitch Berg

## Boss Logic

I left NeXT to take a "leave of absense" to lead one of their

managed the NeXT computers for the NSP Legal Department.

#### Ralph Foy

* Sr Manager Software Engineering
* October 29, 2008
* Ralph worked with Dan but they were at different companies

Dan left mighty big shoes to fill when I started at NeXT. The company he founded was a valuable partner for both NeXT and a company I later worked with, Gage. Dan has the gift of deep technical insight into issues. At a time when it seemed that quick-and-dirty, superficial "solutions" were the fashion, he was a steadfast proponent of quality design--solutions with integrity, to be true to the name of the company he founded.

## ETA Systems

I left Bell Labs to get more experience managing people.  When I was just 26 I was managing a team of 14 people on the ETA Software Engineering Tools team.  We developed tools to make our developers
