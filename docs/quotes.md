## My Own Management vs Leadership Quote

When I was taking classes at the University of St. Thomas MBA program I took a class on leadership.  I realized that many people confused the roles of a manager with the roles of a technology leader.  I started to put the following original quote in my presentations:

*Managers think about today.  Leaders think about tomorrow.*

This quote has been widely used many other setting and I always appreciate attribution!
