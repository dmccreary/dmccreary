# Dan McCreary Quotes

## My Own Management vs Leadership Quote

When I was taking classes at the University of St. Thomas MBA program I took a class on leadership.  I realized that many people confused the roles of a manager with the roles of a technology leader.  I started to put the following original quote in my presentations:

*Managers think about today.  Leaders think about tomorrow.* - Dan McCreary

This quote has been widely used many other setting and I always appreciate attribution!

Management focuses on the day-to-day tasks of managing people, budgets and compliance.  Leadership is about creating a clear vision of the future and letting everyone know how to get there.  Very few people excel at both management and leadership.  Great technologists seldom enjoy day-to-day management tasks.

## My Favorite Quotes From Others

### Knowledge Representation

*Representation is the hardest part of AI.* - Jeff Hawkins

This quote guides most of my research in AI and knowledge representation.  You can think of this as a metaphor for the famous 1976 book by Niklaus Wirth:

**Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs**

which covers some of the fundamental topics of computer programming.  In summary, many hard problems in Computer Science and AI become easy when you pick the right data structure or the right representation of knowledge.  Forcing all data to fit into tabular structures is often a recipe for failure.
