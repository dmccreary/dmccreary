# Dan's Robot Labs

Here is a high-level summary of Dan McCreary's robot labs.
The labs are spread over about 20 websites that each focus on a different topics of STEM, coding, data literacy and AI.

## 1. Robot Day

[Robot Day Website](https://dmccreary.github.io/robot-day/)

This website supports a single-day event at a school.  It puts a focus on low-cost hands-on labs to engage students
in all the steps to build a $19 collision-avoidance robot.

The site puts a focus on helping a school execute the event including ideas for logistics and promotion of a successful event as well as the event tables and labs.

## 2. Beginning Python

[Beginning Python](https://www.coderdojotc.org/python/)

This website contains lessons for students who are just begging to learn to program with Python.  Python has been our most popular language.  We are always looking for Python Mentors who can volunteer to work with girls and disadvantaged youth in these programs.  Most of the lessons run on the kid-save Trinket.com website.  We are most proud of our Journey Map which helps students get oriented on their Python journey.

Note that when we start, students are shown this map.  If they reach the end (not the finish flag) they they get a cool Python sticker.

## 3. MicroPython for Kids

[MicroPython Website](https://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/)

This website contains a huge number of lessons for students to learn physical computing with Python.  We put a focus on the Raspberry Pi Pico and we converted most of our 200+ legacy Arduino labs written in C to use MicroPython.  
This site has hundreds of sample lesson plans and projects as well as extensive documentation
on various kits such as a $19 collision avoidance robot using the RP2040 processor.
Please let me know if you can help contribute sample programs.

As of March of 2023, this site became our most popular site with over five thousand page views each month
from students, teachers and mentors around the world!
Every month we are getting more and more page views and we continue to add new content.

## 4. MicroSims

[MicroSims Website](https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/)

This website contains our current examples of how we use generative AI to create highly customizable simulations for
each classroom.  Most of our examples generate p5.js JavaScript programs that can be customized with prompts.  We
have extraordinary success teaching teachers to use generative AI to create these simulations but also generate
detailed lesson plans that are grade-specific using this approach.

## 5. Moving Rainbow

[Moving Rainbow Website](http://dmccreary.github.io/moving-rainbow)

How much computational thinking can we teach using a $4 microcontroller and a $3 LED strip?  It turns
out the answer is "a lot!".  This website has many examples of learning how to program
Python using really fun bright LED strips.  We can use them as the basis for LED costumes,
wall decorations, night lights, clocks, signs and many more projects.

Although some of the content is a duplicate of the NeoPixel labs on the MicroPython site, we have placed
all the relevant examples and added new detailed content for a class where every participant has these
kits.  This $7 kit and this website has also been used for our Halloween costume [IoT Hackday](https://www.coderdojotc.org/iot-hackday/) and other special events.  This also means we have many mentors who are already familiar with these kits.

## 6. Robot Faces

[Robot Faces Website](https://dmccreary.github.io/robot-faces)

With the advent of low-cost and bright OLED displays, our students have wanted to add "faces" to our robots
that show expressions like happiness, surprise, sleepiness, etc.  These labs use the new MicroPython
ellipse and poly functions introduced in 2023 to make drawing even complex shapes like eyebrows possible.

## 7. Generative AI For Teachers

[Generative AI For Teachers Website](http://www.coderdojotc.org/chatgpt-for-teachers/)

This website was originally started to help teachers use Generative AI to help 
automate time-consuming tasks such as generating customized lesson plans for
students.  It has grown to include a rich library of simulations for helping
instructors demonstrate concepts.  The site also includes a link to the video
of our presentation.

## 8. Clocks and Watches with MicroPython

[MicroPython Clocks and Watches Website](https://dmccreary.github.io/micropython-watch/)

This is our latest project that takes advantage of the new color Smart Watch displays.  Although
the displays cost only around $7 each, they offer bright colors on a 240-240 circular display.
You can program your own digital and analog watch faces as well as build clocks that
synchronize with the time servers for accurate time.  They can even be used
to display the current temperature, weather forecast and phases of the moon.

## 10, AI Racing League

[AI Racing League](https://www.coderdojotc.org/ai-racing-league/)

This site provides resources for an AI Racing League event.
It uses $300 cars powered by a Raspberry Pi with a video camera on a RC car chassis.  Student drive around the track 20 times and gather 20 thousand images of the lines on the track.  These images are set to a GPU server that trains
an machine learning model to use the steering and throttle.  The model is
then transferred back to the car to drive autonomously.

These events require senior mentors that are familiar with the Donkey Car, Python and machine learning.  The events work best with juniors and seniors in high school.

## 11. Beginning Electronics

This site features generative AI resources for instructors
that are teaching basic electronics at the junior high or
high school level.  We assume each student will have access
to around $20 of parts including basic electronics components 
and a breadboard.  We also have MicroSimulations for schools
that don't have the funding for these kits.

## 12. Learning Graphs

This website contains resources teaching the concepts around Learning Graphs.
Learning graphs are concept graphs that are used by AI agents
to generate high quality lesson plans customized to the needs of
students.  This course includes an extensive tutorial
on how to use the vis.js JavaScript framework to create
learning graph visualization and editing tools.

## 13, Graph Learning Management Systems

[Graph Learning Management Systems](https://dmccreary.github.io/graph-lms/)

## 14. Systems Thinking

This course was originally designed for technologist that were
getting involved in analysis of complex IT ecosystems.  We have
extended it with examples so that the resources can also
be used for teaching Systems THinking at the high-school level
using interactive simulations.

[Systems Thinking ](https://dmccreary.github.io/graph-systems-thinking/)

## 15. AI Assisted Geometry

This website contains resources to help teach a high-school level course on geometry.  We have created an extensive learning graph with the key concepts
for a geometry course as well as many MicroSims that allow students
to interactively explored these concepts.  We focus on helping
teachers us generative AI to build and modify these MicroSims using
well designed 2D and 3D geometry templates.

## 16. Signal Processing

This website is designed to help both instructors and students who are interested in learning about signal processing. This website uses generative AI and encourages both instructors and students to use generative AI to create and modify content such as simulations and animations of signal processing concepts.

### Building Intelligent Textbooks with Mkdocs

Mkdocs is an open source build framework wildly used to
create documentation and lessons for instruction.  This
is a guide for instructors building textbooks that
are intelligent and can be quickly customized by AI agents.
