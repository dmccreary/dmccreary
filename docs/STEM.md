## CoderDojoTC Python

[CoderDojo Twin Cities Python Microsite](https://www.coderdojotc.org/python/)

This microsite contains lessons for CoderDojo students to learn Python.  Python has been our most popular language.  We are always looking for Python Mentors that can volunteer to work with girls and disadvantage youth in these programs.

## CoderDojoTC MicroPython Microsite

[CoderDojo Twin Cities MicroPython Microsite](https://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/)

This microsite contains lessons for CoderDojo students to learn MicroPython.  We put a focus on the Raspberrry Pi Pico and we are in the process of upgrading our 100+ legacy Arduino labs written in C to use MicroPython.  
This site has hundreds of sample lesson plans and projects as well as extensive documetnation
on various kits such as a $19 collision avoidance robot using the RP2040 processor.
Please let me know if you can help contribute example programs.

!!! Note
    As of March of 2023 this is our most popular site with over five thousand page views each month.
    Every month we are getting more and more page views and we continue to add new content.

## Moving Rainbow

[Moving Rainbow Website](dmccreary.github.io/moving-rainbow)

How much computational thinking can we teach using a $4 microcontroller and a $3 LED strip?  It turns
out the answer is "a lot!".  This website has many examples of learning how to program
Python using really fun bright LED strips.  We can use them as the basis for LED costumes,
wall decorations, night lights, clocks, signs and many more projects.

## Robot Faces

[Robot Faces Website](https://dmccreary.github.io/robot-faces)

With the advent of low-cost and bright OLED displays our students have wanted to add "faces" to our robots
that show expressions like happiness, surprise, sleepyness, etc.  These labs use the new MicroPython
ellipse and poly functions introduced in 2023 to make drawing even complex shapes like eyebrows possible.

## Clocks and Watches

[MicroPython Clocks and Watches Website](https://dmccreary.github.io/micropython-watch/)

This is our latest project that takes advantage of the new color Smart Watch displays.  Although
the displays cost only around $7 each, they offer bright colors on a 240-240 circular display.
You can program your own digital and analog watch faces as well as build clocks that
synronize with the time servers for accurate time.  They can even be used
to display the current temperature, weather forecast and phases of the moon.

## TED-X Youth Video

[Can we use artificial intelligence to improve education?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ySgwSWCeqs)

In this talk, Dan McCreary shares his take on the question "Can we use artificial intelligence to improve education?" From the 84 billion neurons in human brains to the Netflix suggestion algorithm, Dan McCreary exemplifies the benefits of AI in education. Dan McCreary is an author, speaker, and evangelist for graph technologies. As a Distinguished Engineer at Optum, he works with business units within United Healthcare (Fortune 6) to evaluate and integrate advanced technologies including AI, Graph, and NoSQL into their digital ecosystem.

### A 3D-Printed Mount for Time-of-Flight Distance Sensors
[A 3D-Printed Mount for Time-of-Flight Distance Sensors](https://dmccreary.medium.com/a-3d-printed-mount-for-time-of-flight-distance-sensor-8acea5480709) - this is a great example of a blog that I worked on hard but had a VERY narrow audience.  Clearly there are not a lot of people doing STEM/Robotics AND are interested in 3D printing.
