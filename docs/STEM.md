### A 3D-Printed Mount for Time-of-Flight Distance Sensors
[A 3D-Printed Mount for Time-of-Flight Distance Sensors](https://dmccreary.medium.com/a-3d-printed-mount-for-time-of-flight-distance-sensor-8acea5480709) - this is a great example of a blog that I worked on hard but had a VERY narrow audience.  Clearly there are not a lot of people doing STEM/Robotics AND are interested in 3D printing.
