# Dan McCrary's Patents

## Patents Granted

* [Automated concepts for interrogating a document storage database](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11204950B2/en) - this is the
technology that many people call "semantic search" today.  I really
didn't think this was that novel.  It seemed like just common sense.
I think that if Optum wanted to, they could get a lot of money defending this patent since today many people use the process I outlined in the patent.
