August 25th 2019 blog post on how we are moving to hardware-optimized graph databases.

The evolution of large-scale big data technologies driving AI. We are building on knowledge gained from single-node graphs, Data Lakes, Data Hubs, and Enterprise Knowledge Graphs. In the future, we will see low-cost extensible custom VLSI graph hardware dedicated to solving large graph problems.

### Connecting Healthcare

[Connecting Healthcare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj_DyFKFzSI)

This was a talk I did for the Neo4j GraphConnect conference in 2018.

Many healthcare organizations today only see small parts of the healthcare system. Few organizations are taking a long-term holistic approach to gaining insights into healthcare. Much of the high costs are driven by the lack of connected information. Making a high quality prediction of how to improve healthcare for an individual means taking many data points into account.

Graph databases are the fastest growing type of databases today.  Although their flexibility has always been strong, now they have scale-out ability to cost-effectively store every touchpoint of our interactions with our customers including down to the individual slide they view. Learn more about how graph databases cost-effectively store all detail of customer interactions, how organizations currently use this knowledge, and how faculty can use this technology to help the learning experience of students.
