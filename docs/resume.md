*Retired AI Researcher working in helping educational organizations
embrace AI and intelligent textbooks*

### Looking for Partners

Dan is looking for partners that are interested in
using AI in education.  Dan believes that by combining
precise learning graphs with AI that personalized intelligent textbooks
can have huge impact on education.

### About Dan

Dan is a seasoned **Solution Architect** with a profound background in **Knowledge Representation for AI**. Dan has extensive experience in building the worldâ€™s largest **Enterprise Knowledge Graphs** for integrated member, customer, provider and patient records. Dan is passionate about helping organizations create precise, scalable models above tens of billions of vertices. My personal mission is to assist individuals and organizations in performing objective solution architecture analysis through the art of **storytelling**.

Dan has a unique skill.  He can clearly **visualize how data moves** through hardware, through networks, through databases, and through software applications. Dan can "see" data movement from the lowest chip level all the way up through complex application stacks.  This visual thinking skill allows him to quickly understand the fitness of knowledge representations to business problems.
The ability to see entire systems at work gives Dan a unique [Systems Thinking](https://dmccreary.github.io/graph-systems-thinking/) perspective on problem solving
and architecture tradeoff analysis.
