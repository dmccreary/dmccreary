# Dan McCreary on AI Hardware

Since 2019 we have seen an explosion in investment in innovative AI acceleration hardware.  Here are a few articles I have written about this topic.

## [Intel’s Incredible PIUMA Graph Analytics Hardware](https://dmccreary.medium.com/intels-incredible-piuma-graph-analytics-hardware-a2e9c3daf8d8)

This November 2020 blog is one of the highest ranked articles on Intel PIUMA.

For the last few years, I have been promoting the idea of the Hardware Graph. My assertion was that graph hardware needs a focus on simple pointer hopping at scale. I have always stated is that the best way to do this is to use full-custom ASIC chips and memory designed for random memory access that supports pointer hopping over large memory footprints.

This blog is a metaphorical journey that many of us are taking toward the concept of building large enterprise-scale knowledge graphs (EKGs). We will look at the three transitions that teams need to make to go from problem-solving using flat representations of data to billion-vertex EKGs running on hardware-optimized graph servers.
