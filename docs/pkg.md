# Dan McCreary's Work on Personal Knowledge Graphs

If are we are going to build high quality "Personal AI Agents", they will need to be able to access all your
personal notes.  They best way to store personal notes is
in a personal knowledge graph (PKGs).  But integrating all
the employee PKGs into a companies AI system is complex.  My blogs
focuse on how we can securly integrate PKGs into an organzation's collective knowledge.

## My Blogs on Personal Knowledge Graphs

In 2022, with the encouragement of Arun Batchu, I wrote four blogs on personal knowledge graphs.  These blogs have been very popular and are
being uses as the basis for many projects that are creating personal knowledge agents.

[Personal Knowledge Graphs](https://towardsdatascience.com/personal-knowledge-graphs-9a23a0b099af) - this is one of my most popular blogs with over 1,000 claps.  The orignal blog was reposed on the Towards Data Science publication.  The article was originally published on Apr 6, 2022.

[Integrating PKGs into the Enterprise](https://medium.com/p/31c913b96b94) - published December 5th 2020.

My blogs were turned into Chapter 14 of the book: Personal Knowledge Graphs: Methodology, Tools and Applications.
