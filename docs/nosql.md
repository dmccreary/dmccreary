## Webinar: The National Information Exchange Model and Semantic-Driven Development
Recorded April 14, 2010, 11:00AM

[The National Information Exchange Model and Semantic-Driven Development](https://www.dataversity.net/the-national-information-exchange-model-and-semantic-driven-development/)

Since 2002, several US federal agencies have been deploying XML standards for the exchange of complex data sets. Led by a large project at the US Department of Justice and homeland security, there are now hundreds of states and vendors supporting an emerging XML standard called the National Information Exchange Model or NIEM. This presentation will look at the NIEM processes and show how they are being used to promote semantically precise data exchanges as well as promoting transparency in government. We will compare ISO-based NIEM processes with RDF and OWL and show how they complement each other.
