<ul>
<li>Technology Fellow at UnitedHealth Group / Optum</li>
<li>August 10, 2023</li>
<li>Mark managed Dan directly</li>
<li>Mark is the highest ranked technologist at UHG</li>
<li>Mark was the most influetial user of the Healthcare Graph</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favorite people to work with at Optum : Dan McCreary. Dan is relentlessly positive in all of his interactions with co-workers, has an amazing capacity for knowledge, and is always eager to learn and to collaborate. I was fortunate enough to meet Dan on my first day at Optum, and we immediately discovered a mutual kinship, love for data and analytics, and a desire to improve healthcare. Dan has expertise in a wide range of advanced technology areas, and we probably spent the most time working on graph database technology as it applies to healthcare and clinical analytics, but also worked on many other projects and even collaborated on some patent disclosures. Truly a wonderful colleague and friend.</p>
<h4 id="jeff-compas">Jeff Compas<a class="headerlink" href="#jeff-compas" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Distinguished Engineer at Optum</li>
<li>August 14, 2023</li>
<li>Jeff worked with Dan but on different teams</li>
</ul>
<p>Every now and then, the ebs and flows of life in a large corporation bring you into the proximity of great people. Dan is a great person who I had the privilege to work with periodically at Optum. He has a tremendous and contagious vision of how to bring the most cutting edge technologies to use in solving real-world problems. He is inquisitive, positive and a delight to work with.</p>
<h4 id="rama-kulasekaran">Rama Kulasekaran<a class="headerlink" href="#rama-kulasekaran" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Head of Product Engineering | Building High-Performing Teams | Mentor | Early Career and Diversity Program Advocate</li>
<li>September 10, 2023</li>
<li>Rama worked with Dan on the same team</li>
</ul>
<p>I have had the pleasure of working with Dan at Optum. Dan brings with him passion, innovation, advice and strategic insight that allows businesses to better address their challenges via AI, ML and tools around it. Dan always looks for ways to help improve early careers students with knowledge in AI and he is engaged and builds solid relationships with his clients and business partners. I would recommend Dan as he has great work ethics, and is dedicated to his role, and believes in a positive and ethical work environment.</p>
<h4 id="steve-graham">Steve Graham<a class="headerlink" href="#steve-graham" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Senior Distinguisned Engineer, Now Retired</li>
<li>August 17, 2023</li>
<li>Steve and I worked together in the Optum Advanced Technology Collaborative</li>
</ul>
<p>I worked with Dan when we were both Distinguished Engineers at Optum. Dan is a very rare talent: able to combine deep technical knowledge with sound understanding of business needs. Dan is a thought leader on databases, specifically NOSQL databases and especially Graph databases. Dan drove the adoption of Graph databases within United Health Group, evangelizing the technology, identifying business opportunities that were ideally addressed by Graph databases. Dan partnered with business leaders, solution architects and developers to develop dozens of solutions using graph databases.</p>
<p>Most recently, Dan took a leadership position in researching how Graph databases could be applied as a basis for AI. The notion of using networks of related objects as the basis for machine learning is quite cutting edge and has broad applicability within health care and other industries. Dan combines a passion for technology, an enthusiastic curiosity for applying technology to solve business problems and a patient skill for transferring knowledge. I learned a lot from working with Dan and I continue to be inspired by his dedication to learning technology and sharing that learning with others.</p>

<p>Dan was one of the first people I met when I joined Advanced Technology Collaborative, a small group of advanced thinkers and technology experts within Optum. Coming back into technology, especially advanced technology, after 10 years in business, posed a steep learning curve. Dan was key to overcoming this challenge. Dan’s depth and breadth of knowledge about databases, hardware, knowledge graphs and his amazing ability to distill these complex topics into stories that a rusty technologist like me could understand and more importantly apply to real life problems, accelerated my speed to value. With Dan’s leadership and influence, Optum implemented the largest connected data set in healthcare, using graph technologies. Dan is always positive, always looking around the corner to see what is next and is always looking for new ideas and applications. I will always be proud to call Dan my mentor and friend.</p>

<p>Dan's encouragement and enthusiasm has played a substantial role in the development of the engineer that I am today. He was my guide while I was starting to learn about machine learning and graph analytical techniques. He was instrumental in my development as a teacher -- something I find important as we try to democratize access to machine learning. Dan demonstrated how to make complex topics like computer vision and driverless RC cars approachable. He then helped me do the same with a course on graph-based machine learning. Dan is known for his approachable and welcoming demeanour. That would give me the extra bit of confidence to try new things and grow. This has a compounding affect, since conquering one seemingly insurmountable mountain can inspire you to conquer the next mountain of a topic.</p>

As an advocate and teacher that leads and guides many people through their first understanding on how to apply these technologies in business Dan is the best in his field. He has the technical aptitude to understand and help explain these to leaders and his acumen is top notch. On top of his excellence in technology and business, Dan is also maybe one of the most empathetic and socially intelligent people I know and working together with him through the years has been a joy and I consider him one of the best of friends. When things get difficult in business or technology Dan is often a guiding force that engineers of all levels look up to. Dan makes learning new things at scale and speed easy and fun, often engaging at the highest level of learning and efficiency. For any business or technology leader interested in hiring Dan my advice is to move fast :) Dan with his generative AI background, his large scale advocacy and teaching capabilities and his understanding of data science and engineering, he is likely to have many opportunities. Last Dan has integrity and heart - I feel in business and technology his level of resilience and care is likely to form really strong bonds wherever he goes. Good luck on your next adventure Dan!

<p>I had the opportunity to partner with Dan over the course of a couple years as we teamed up to uncover, understand and solution the needs for a highly strategic and demanding client. Dan excels at building relationships and gaining trust with his clients - which is easy for him to do as there is no one more well-studied, highly-experienced and knowledgeable in his field. As a result, he quickly gains credibility. As a result, he was able to strengthen the relationship with the client with his work leading to increased revenue for MarkLogic. I would would welcome an opportunity to work with Dan again soon.</p>

<p>In technology you rarely get a chance to work with a person that is as personable as they are technically proficient. Dan is one of those rare people and it is an absolute pleasure to work with him. Dan has led and successfully delivered very strategic pre-sales and post-sales consulting engagements for one of my top healthcare clients (a top 5 payer and health services company). I am 100% comfortable with Dan's solution identification and development skills, his presentation skills, and his excellent client relationship management.</p>
<p>Dan is one of the few people I trust to interact with clients on his own without involving a sales / relationship manager. He cares deeply about his clients, company (integrated account team) and their mutual success. Several key wins have happened, or opportunities have been generated, due to Dan's natural curiosity, credibility and trust he has built in understanding client strategies, goals, pains and developing solutions to help achieve them.</p>
<p>Dan is an "A-list" IT consulting talent and even better person. He goes the extra mile to mitigate risk (both technical and process) and ensure success, positive results and satisfaction. In return, I go the extra mile for him when he asks because he's earned it.</p>
